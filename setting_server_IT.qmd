## Why I need a server

External servers help with different tasks:

  - Get access to more computational power to perform your analyses
  - Hosting a web for a research project or research group
  - Hosting resources and applications
  - A place to share and store data
  - Others...

## Why a dedicated server in a data center?

When in need of a server (for web hosting, data sharing or computational tasks) we have two main
options, hosting ourselves the server or rent a dedicated server. These servers have several
advantages:

  (@) Available physical space: CREAF lacks of more space for servers, but the UAB offers space in
  the **insert here name of the facility of UAB where servers are**.
  
  (@) Downtime: Hosting ourselves a server in CREAF/UAB premises means that we depend on the UAB
  network. While this networks is fast and usually reliable, means that any failure in the network
  (at UAB or CREAF level) will affect access to the server.  
  Remote servers on the other hand are more reliable in this case.
  
  (@) UAB firewalls: Setting up a web, RStudio server or other software to being access outside the
  UAB usually involves a lot of work and constant contact with CREAF and UAB IT services until is
  correctly configured. Even with that, UAB policies changes from time to time without much notice.  
  Server clouds are controlled by us, so we control access and firewalls (downside is that we control
  access and firewall, so we need to configure them if needed).

## How to select a server

### Data center company

CREAF recommends [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) as the cloud server provider.

### Needs

Choosing a server depends largely on the work that is gonna be done in it. Usually, the most
important aspects to check on the server are:

  - RAM: RAM will limit the computational power provided by the server, specially if we work with
  R programming language, that relies in RAM storage for objects.  
  - Processor cores: Number of cores will limit the availability of concurrent processes. Specially
  important when we plan on parallelize analyses or workflows.
  - Drive storage and type: Storage capacity will limit the amount of data (temporal or permanent)
  that we can store in the server. Drive type will affect the speed of the access to the data.
  - Location of the server: This has a legal consequence. Servers outside European Union must
  comply with GDPR legislation (data protection)

Here we'll describe several scenarios and the more important aspects to look at in each of them:

  1. **Hosting a web page for a simple project or research group**  
  Hosting simple web pages require not so much computational power, as well as storage. But it
  requires fast access to the files (specially if we have a static webpage). In this scenario the
  recommendations would be:
  
      + RAM: 16GB (as its the minimum Hetzner offers in dedicated servers)
      + Cores: 6 cores (as its the minimum Hetzner offers in dedicated servers)
      + Drive type: SSD
      + Drive capacity: Depends on the web to host, but 1 Tb is more than enough
      + Location: inside EU
  
  1. **RStudio server for analyses**  
  Hosting a RStudio server allows to have a centralized place for all research group members to
  code, share and store research projects. Different accounts can have its own Rstudio accessible
  from any place with internet connection. The characteristics of the server depends largely on the
  computations intended to be performed by the server:
  
      + RAM: 16GB to 128GB. Normal work like linear models, small and medium size data... will not
      require big amount of RAM, 16GB will suffice. Intensive work as big data (+1 million rows),
      spatial data with high resolutions, parallelization of time consuming analyses... will require
      more RAM, up to 128GB or even more.
      + Cores: 6 cores to 20 cores. Again depends on the type of computation needed. If
      paralellization is going to be an important step, then more cores is better (must also be
      paired with more RAM)
      + Drive type: SSD, will speed the data access.
      + Drive capacity: Depend on the size of the data intended to be used, but 4 Tb is a good
      starting point.

### RAID

If the server is intended to work also as a backup server, or data integrity is really really
important, then a [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID) can be also configured in the server.
In layman terms, a RAID system duplicate storage drives present in the server, using the duplicates
for storing a copy of the data present in the *normal" drives. The extra space in the duplicated
drives is not accessible, as it works mirroring the contents of the other drives.

This is more complex of sertting up and maintaing, and this document will not cover RAID.

### Operative system

The only one, linux. Sorry, this is what it is. Windows servers are insecure by default, more
exploited in the wild and require a more complex maintenance. Linux servers have also security
exploits, but are easier to maintain, and applying a frequent updates policy, are more secure by
default than Windows servers.

## Steps to rent a remote server

  1. Look at the previus sections of this document and decide what kind of server you need in terms
  of RAM and cores range.
  
  1. Contact CREAF IT team at https://suport.creaf.cat/support/home and create a ticket with the
  following info:
  
     - **to fill**
  
  1. Wait until IT confirms the process is done.
  
  1. You have a remote server.
